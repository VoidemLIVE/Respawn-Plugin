# Respawn Plugin
It respawns people.

When a player dies, it will respawn them without showing the death screen. It will send them to one of three spawns that is decided by the player's permission node.

Commands:
- /resplug reload
- /resplug setspawn [guest/staff/vip]

The resplug command cannot be used by console as setspawn gets the player's current location to make the spawn point

Permission nodes:
- resplug.guest (Sends to guest spawn, default)
- resplug.staff (Sends to staff spawn)
- resplug.vip (Sends to vip spawn)
- resplug.main (Gives access to the /resplug admin menu)

# This plugin isn't planned to recieve any updates
I just wanted a more public version of this plugin available rather than the one on [Greenwood Park](https://github.com/Greenwood-Parks)'s organization profile.

Available on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/respawn-plugin.114001/)
